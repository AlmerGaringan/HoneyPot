# HoneyPot
A honeypot is a fake vulnerable network to trick attackers so we are able to analyze their behavior, including how they attack and where they attack. The reason I wanted to build a honeypot is to deepen my skills and learn how attackers behave, as well as where most attackers originate from. I learned a lot while building this project, including Linux, firewalls, security grouping, cloud providers, and defensive security.
