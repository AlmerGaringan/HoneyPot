# HoneyPot
A honeypot is a fake vulnerable network to trick attackers. Then we are able to analyze their behavior in which how they're attacking and where they're attacking. The reason I wanted to build a honeypot is because I wanted to deepen my skills and also learn how attackers behave and where most attackers come home.
